# CI/CD Documentation Migration

The comprehensive CI/CD plan has been migrated to GitHub Copilot's instructions format for better integration with AI-assisted development.

## New Location

- **Active Instructions**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Original Plan Archive**: `docs/CI_CD_PLAN_ARCHIVE.md`

## Benefits of Migration

- ✅ **AI Integration**: Copilot can reference deployment guidelines during code generation
- ✅ **Contextual Assistance**: Development standards automatically available
- ✅ **Consistent Implementation**: Automated adherence to project conventions
- ✅ **Real-time Guidance**: CI/CD best practices during workflow creation

## Usage

The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file provides:

- Project-specific coding standards
- Deployment architecture guidelines
- CI/CD pipeline requirements
- Docker and uv usage patterns
- Security and testing conventions

GitHub Copilot will automatically reference these instructions when helping with:

- Creating workflow files
- Writing deployment scripts
- Implementing tests
- Configuring Docker setups
- Following project conventions
